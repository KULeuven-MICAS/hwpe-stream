# HWPE Stream Dockertest Container
The dockerfile contains the build instructions for the container. It is compatible for cocotb and Verilator. Once built simply go into the `/cocotb` directory and run `pytest`.

## Alternative docker download
You can download an uploaded build by running:
``` bash
docker pull rgantonio/cocotb-hwpe-stream
```
